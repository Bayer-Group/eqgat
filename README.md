## Overview
Here we provide benchmark scripts for our experiments on the EQGAT architecture.
Make sure to install the `eqgat` library.

```
git clone https://github.com/Bayer-Group/eqgat.git
cd eqgat
```

This repository is organised as follows:

* `eqgat/` contains the implementation of the Equivariant Graph Attention Model with all required submodules. Additionally, we provide implementations of other recent 3D Graph Neural Networks.
* `experiments/` contains the 5 python training-scripts from the [ATOM3D](https://www.atom3d.ai/) and 1 synthetic datasets. To execute each training script, please refer to the corresponding README.md in the sub-directories. 

### Installation with GPU support
```
# install the conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml 
conda activate eqgat
pip install -e .
```

### Experiments
All experiments presented in the paper can be found in the `experiments/` directory.  
Make sure to download all requested public datasets from [ATOM3D](https://www.atom3d.ai/) as described in the corresponding READMEs.


### Example 
A minimal example using the proposed SO(3) equivariant graph attention network can be found in `eqgat/README.md`
